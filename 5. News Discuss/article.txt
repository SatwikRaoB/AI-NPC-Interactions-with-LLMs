UTICA, N.Y. -- The Arc, Oneida Lewis "Fine Arc Program" has a new home in downtown Utica. 
Today they held their grand ribbon cutting ceremony in the new M building located on Genesee Street formerly known as the Mayro Building.
By moving into the new location, it allows the program to serve more people while becoming a visible part of Utica's emerging art.
Fine Arc is a creative hub for people with developmental disabilities and a passion for art. 
This space allows the artists to showcase their artwork, and they can sell them as well. 
DJ Torrellas, artist at the Fine Arc, said it feels great to be in the new building.
"I drew a lot of things. The class and the staff here we are ready for the next challenge and I hope many people come here to see the fine arts and enjoy some stuff," said Torrellas.
Torrellas already sold some paintings during the grand opening.

UTICA, N.Y. -- April is Child Abuse Prevention month, and today local leaders gathered to place pinwheels outside the Oneida County office building.
Pinwheels are used as a symbol that every kid deserves a great childhood. 
In 2024, The Child Advocacy Center investigated 906 cases of child abuse in 2024, serving 832 children. 
784 cases were sexual and physical child abuse, and 27 neglect cases. The investigations led to 60 arrests.
The biggest message that was given at the event is when you see something, say something.
"We want anybody witnessing child abuse to call the state mandated reporter number, but if you think somebody needs help so it doesn't get to that point. You can call us. We can provide services and we generally connect them to one of our community services that we have contracts with," said Kari Barber, director of services for the department of family & community services for Oneida County.

Tri Valley Dry Cleaners, in Herkimer, is opening their hearts, and their washing machines, to people without water in the village right now, due to recent water main problems.
"Well, we have seven families that don't have water right now, so they're welcome. Welcome to come down," says Max Dhaniram, of Tri-Valley Dry Cleaners, in Herkimer.
Free laundry and Max, who's also a village trustee, is offering those families use of the shower, in his home.
"There are people in need right now. They have no water. Water is the most important thing for life. We need to help these people until we get back online. It's that simple,' said Max.
As a village official, Max is not only offering water, but reassurance.
"The reason why we're asking people to conserve is because we have two pumps working, two artesian wells, we overrun those pumps and they get hot and something goes wrong, then we have a bigger problem.....the water is there. We have the water," said Max. "People don't have to worry about water. We just have to conserve it so that we don't destroy one of our pumps."
A landslide broke a major main off Rt. 28, over the weekend. It's about a quarter mile walk into the woods, so it's hard to get personnel and equipment to it, but village officials say they're in the final stages of a temporary solution to reattach the main and restore services to the northern line, and they plan to begin the repair work, Thursday. In the meantime, a state of emergency and water conservation advisory.

Title: NY State Testing Delayed Because of Tech Issues | News | wktv.com
Content: NY State Testing Delayed Because of Tech Issues | News | wktv.com
AP
ALBANY, N.Y. -- For the second straight day, school districts statewide were not able to give state tests because of computer issues.
Testing was supposed to happen for grades 3-8. NYSED released the following statement:
"For the second consecutive day, a number of schools across the state experienced a slowdown with the Grades 3-8 Computer-Based Testing System. NYSED apologizes to schools, students, and families and, like those who were impacted, finds this situation unacceptable. Make no mistake: the state's testing vendor, NWEA, is solely responsible for the issues that have affected testing this year. We have been in contact with NWEA leadership to demand answers for why this situation has occurred and solutions to ensure that students will not be impacted any further during the spring 2025 testing window. This situation is unacceptable, and NYSED will be holding NWEA responsible for not meeting expectations and contractual obligations.
NWEA has provided assurances that a permanent solution has been put in place to avoid any further slowdowns, but it is understandable if schools wish to wait to ensure that there are no more issues before recommencing testing. For those schools whose students were able to log in successfully and take the tests, their responses are being recorded, and their sessions are being submitted successfully. Schools that encountered issues with logging in to the system may either pause testing today or complete tests today now that the system has stabilized.
NYSED understands that the loss of two testing days impacts a school's testing plans and may require flexibility to ensure there is sufficient time to complete the Grades 3-8 Tests. To offer additional time, the computer-based testing window will be extended by one week to May 23. The tests will remain on the computer-based platform, and NYSED will ensure that NWEA offers ample support to schools that may require it.
We continue to monitor the situation and thank our school communities for their patience."

Content: After Decades of Sex Abuse Complaints, a NY Pediatrician Is Ordered to Pay $1.6B to Over 100 Women | Crime | wktv.com
MERRICK, N.Y. (AP) — Starting in the 1980s, New York law enforcement and health officials fielded sexual abuse complaints from the young patients of a respected pediatrician who ran his practice out of a basement office in his home on Long Island.
But Stuart Copperman was never charged with any crime, and it was only as he approached retirement in 2000, at the age of 65, that he was stripped of his medical license over the complaints.
Now, 25 years later, more than 100 of his former patients have some vindication in their yearslong fight: a court has ordered him to pay a total of $1.6 billion.
The Rev. Debbi Rhodes, who was awarded $25 million, says the completion of the litigation in late March in state Supreme Court brought a mix of relief and frustration.
“I’m not sure if he’s facing justice. He kind of got away with it for all these years,” the 63-year-old Episcopal priest in Las Vegas said by phone. “But to have a court say, definitively, ‘I believe you.’ To hear that -- that’s heavy medicine right there.”
A Manhattan lawyer who has represented Copperman over the years didn’t respond to multiple messages seeking comment in recent days.
Copperman has steadfastly denied the allegations, suggesting he was simply being “thorough” in his examinations, which his former patients say were typically conducted after he had ushered their parents out of the room.
Some of the women filed complaints with local police and medical boards over the years, but no criminal charges or disciplinary actions were ever imposed, according to Rhodes' lawsuit and others. Then a state medical board revoked his license after hearing from six accusers.
Statute of limitations laws, however, prevented Copperman's accusers from filing lawsuits until passage of New York’s Child Victims Act, a 2019 law that temporarily allowed people to file suits over sexual abuse they suffered long ago as children.
The Catholic Church and other major institutions have reached huge settlements to resolve sexual misconduct claims, but lawyers for the women say their litigation has resulted in one of the largest cumulative awards against a single individual in the U.S.
"For decades, these women were silenced and dismissed,” said Kristen Gibbons Feden, a Philadelphia lawyer representing the women. “Now, they cannot be ignored.”
The Long Island court ruled for the women because Copperman never responded to the litigation. But some of the special referees, in assessing damages, said they believed the women.
“The psychological scars from the abuse suffered by Plaintiff are profound and permanent," wrote William Bodkin in awarding $27 million to a woman identified as “Jane Doe T.A.” in April 2024.
“Here, there can only be outrage at Copperman’s reprehensible conduct," he wrote in Rhodes' $25 million judgment in December 2024.
The last of the 104 awards were handed down March 28, with amounts ranging from $500,000 to $32 million, according to Michael Della, a Long Island-based attorney also representing the women.
The women also sued local hospitals and health care networks, but those claims were dismissed.
Like many of the accusers, Rhodes says Copperman sexually abused her during routine visits at his home office in Merrick, some 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Manhattan. She says the abuse started in 1968 when she was 7 years old, and led to an eating disorder and alcohol and drug problems at an early age.
Rhodes says she speaks openly and often about her childhood trauma as part of her ministry, which includes working with prison inmates. She still wrestles with anxiety, depression and other mental health impacts.
“Nobody can grow if they are living in shame. Nobody can really change," said Rhodes, who has two now-grown children and whose husband is also an Episcopal priest. "I’m not even sure you can love if you’re living in shame.”
The Associated Press typically does not name people who say they have been sexually assaulted unless they come forward publicly, as Rhodes has.
Another woman who was awarded $27 million but declined to be named said revisiting childhood trauma during her deposition was painful but, in a way, healing.
“It feels good to know that someone heard us,” the woman, identified in the litigation as “Jane Doe A.W.,” said in a phone interview. “People now understand the magnitude of what he did.”
Lawyers for the women say they have retained a collections specialist to begin pursuing compensation from Copperman.
But Rhodes and other plaintiffs say they’ve accepted the possibility they may never see much, if any. Copperman is now 89 years old and lives in South Florida.
“I’m not sure what justice looks like even if I got a million dollars tomorrow,” Rhodes said. “For me, it’s about saying to other women who are facing this that someone will listen to you. I wasn’t believed for a very long time. Don’t stay silent. Speak your truth.”

Title: Trump Administration Cancels $188M in Grants New York City Was Using to Shelter Migrants | State | wktv.com
Content: Trump Administration Cancels $188M in Grants New York City Was Using to Shelter Migrants | State | wktv.com
The Trump administration canceled $188 million in federal grants meant to reimburse New York City for sheltering migrants, saying the money was being spent to support illegal immigration and leading the city's mayor to vow to fight the clawback.
In a letter sent April 1 and shared with The Associated Press on Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency informed city officials that it was canceling the grants, which included roughly $80 million that the agency withdrew from city's bank account in February.
The latest move would require the city to return an additional $106 million that officials said was used to house and care for migrants.
Mayor Eric Adams, whose administration has sued for the return of the initial $80 million, said his office would also fight the wider grant cancellations.
“Like their previous actions clawing back appropriated funds, these steps are unlawful, and the New York City Law Department is currently determining the best legal recourse to take to ensure that this money remains in New York City, where it was allocated and belongs,” he said in a statement.
The grants are part of a program approved by Congress and administered by FEMA that is intended to help local governments and nongovernmental organizations provide shelter and other social services for migrants.
In his letter to city officials, FEMA's acting director, Cameron Hamilton, wrote that the grant program is inconsistent with Trump administration priorities and that “individuals receiving these services often have no legal status and are in the United States unlawfully.”
New York City, as it at one point absorbed thousands of migrants each week, leased hotels and other vacant buildings and used them as emergency shelters. The city, under a unique legal agreement, is required to provide shelter to anyone who asks for it, though officials worked to impose limits on the requirement as the city struggled to handle the influx.
Among the facilities leased by the city was the midtown Manhattan building that once housed the historic Roosevelt Hotel, which was converted to a shelter and an arrival center for migrants to sign up for social services.
The city's use of the Roosevelt drew heavy criticism from Republicans and federal officials, who said the building had become a hotbed of gang activity and used that claim to justify the clawing back of the $80 million FEMA grant. The city, in its lawsuit over the funding, said the claim was unsubstantiated.
The mayor has said that the city will cease operations at the Roosevelt and more than 50 other migrant shelters by June because arrivals have plummeted and migrants have been moved to other housing and communities.
Adams has been under intense pressure to prove his political independence from the Trump administration after the Department of Justice pushed to toss his federal corruption case so he could help with the Republican president's immigration crackdown.
A federal judge dismissed the charges last week.
At a news conference Tuesday, Adams, a Democrat who is running for reelection as an independent, praised some of the Trump administration's immigration policies but added that “we're going to fight for every penny” related to migrant costs.

Title: Democratic-Led Cities and States Push Back on Threats to Cut US School Funding Over DEI | Local | wktv.com
Content: Democratic-Led Cities and States Push Back on Threats to Cut US School Funding Over DEI | Local | wktv.com
WASHINGTON (AP) — Some Democratic-led states and cities are pushing back on a Trump administration threat to cut education funding over diversity, equity and inclusion programs, creating a standoff that could test how far the White House is willing to go to press its demands on the nation’s schools.
State leaders in Minnesota and New York said they will not comply with an Education Department order to gather signatures from local school systems certifying compliance with civil rights laws, including the rejection of what the federal government calls “illegal DEI practices.” Chicago’s mayor promised to sue over any cuts. California and Vermont told schools they don't need to respond.
It amounts to some of the most forceful opposition the Education Department has faced as it uses federal funding as leverage to enact President Donald Trump’s agenda on issues from DEI to campus antisemitism and transgender athletes. The White House has targeted colleges and K-12 schools alike, but unlike universities that rely greatly on federal grants and contracts, school systems get the vast majority of their money from state and local sources.
In a letter Monday to the Education Department, Minnesota’s education chief said the Trump administration overstepped its authority with its latest demand, adding that there’s nothing illegal about DEI.
“Threats to this funding without backing in law or established requirements put key programs at risk that students and schools depend on every day,” said Willie Jett, Minnesota's education commissioner. The federal department “does not have the authority to unilaterally overrule the will of Congress.”
Jett said his letter would “serve as our response” to the Trump administration’s demand.
It follows a Friday letter from New York’s education office challenging the federal government’s latest demand. It said New York already has provided assurances that it follows federal law and “no further certification will be forthcoming.”
The U.S. Education Department told state agencies in a letter Thursday they must sign a document saying they follow federal antidiscrimination laws and get the same assurance from schools. The document threatens to cut federal money for any civil rights violation, including using DEI practices “to advantage one's race over another.”
On Tuesday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon commended Puerto Rico for being the first to submit its certification. “Every state that wants to continue receiving federal funds should follow suit,” McMahon posted on X.
The letter does not carry the force of law but threatens to use civil rights enforcement to rid schools of DEI practices. Schools that continue such practices “in violation of federal law” can face Justice Department litigation and a termination of federal grants and contracts, it said.
The letter initially gave states 10 days to submit the certification. On Monday, the Education Department extended the deadline to April 24.
A department spokesperson said the agency is “simply asking school districts to certify they are following the law and not using race preferences or pernicious race stereotypes in schools.”
Even some Republican-led states believe they don’t need to get the document signed by each school. Missouri’s education office said schools previously provided assurances that should cover the department’s demand and it will reach out to districts “if additional information is necessary.”
Others are moving to follow the order, including Virginia and Arizona, where state education chief Tom Horne said the order “aligns completely with my philosophy.”
Vermont’s education chief assured schools the state supports DEI practices and said superintendents won’t need to sign the certification. Instead, the state will assure federal officials it’s already following federal law, Zoie Saunders, the state’s education secretary, said in a Monday letter to school districts.
The Illinois board of education rebuked the federal agency, saying it’s “attempting to exert power over every district in the country — even as it claims it’s returning education to the states.” Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a Democrat, said his city is willing to go to court over the order, which he called federal overreach.
The New York and Minnesota letters both cite past comments from Betsy DeVos, Trump’s education secretary during his first term, extolling the virtues of diversity and inclusion. In a 2020 memo to agency staff, DeVos wrote that “embracing diversity and inclusion are key elements for success.” The states argue the Education Department is shifting its position without explanation.
The states also accuse the Education Department of making broad declarations about the illegality of DEI without citing policies that violate federal law. Minnesota’s letter said if the federal agency has identified DEI practices that violate civil rights law, “we request advisement of them.”
Many states said they’re still reviewing the letter.

Title: NY Public Schools Tell Trump Administration They Won't Comply With DEI Order | Education | wktv.com
Content: NY Public Schools Tell Trump Administration They Won't Comply With DEI Order | Education | wktv.com
New York state officials have told the Trump administration that they will not comply with its demands to end diversity, equity and inclusion practices in public schools, despite the administration's threats to terminate federal education funding.
Daniel Morton-Bentley, counsel and deputy commissioner of the state Department of Education, said in a letter dated Friday to the federal Education Department that state officials do not believe the federal agency has the authority to make such demands.
“We understand that the current administration seeks to censor anything it deems ‘diversity, equity & inclusion,’” he wrote. “But there are no federal or State laws prohibiting the principles of DEI.”
Morton-Bentley also wrote state officials were “unaware” of any authority the federal Department of Education has to demand that states agree with its interpretation of court decisions or to terminate funding without a formal administrative process.
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.
The Trump administration on Thursday ordered K-12 schools nationwide to certify within 10 days that they are following federal civil rights laws and ending any discriminatory DEI practices, as a condition for receiving federal money. Federal funding comprises about 6% of the total funding for New York K-12 schools.
“Federal financial assistance is a privilege, not a right,” Craig Trainor, acting assistant secretary for civil rights, said in a statement when the demand was made. He said many schools have flouted their legal obligations, “including by using DEI programs to discriminate against one group of Americans to favor another.”
The certification demand asked state and school leaders to sign a “reminder of legal obligations” acknowledging their federal money is conditioned on compliance with federal civil rights laws. It also demands compliance with several pages of legal analysis written by the administration.
The demand specifically threatens Title I funding, which sends billions of dollars a year to America’s schools and targets low-income areas.
Morton-Bentley wrote that the state Education Department has already certified to the federal government on multiple occasions that it is complying with Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most recently in January. He said the federal department is basing its demands to end DEI programs on a faulty legal interpretation.
“Given the fact that you are already in possession of guarantees by NYSED that it has and will comply with Title VI, no further certification will be forthcoming,” he wrote.
He also said the administration's stance is an “abrupt shift” from the one taken by the first Trump administration, citing comments in 2020 made by then-U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos that diversity and inclusion were “cornerstones of high organizational performance." He wrote the administration has provided no explanation of why it changed positions.
Critics of the certification demand said it conflicted with Trump's promise to return education to schools and states.
The threat of financial sanctions is similar to ones the Trump administration has been leveraging against colleges in its effort to crack down on protests against Israel that it deems antisemitic.
New York state has similarly refused to comply with a demand by the Trump administration to shut down a program to fund mass transit in New York City with high tolls on cars that drive into Manhattan.

AP
NEW YORK (AP) — Columbia University must give detained activist Mahmoud Khalil and other students 30 days' notice before handing over any more documents to Congress as it investigates antisemitism on college campuses, a federal judge in New York ruled Friday.
But U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian stopped short of outright blocking the Manhattan university from complying with the congressional requests, as lawyers for the activists sought.
Instead, the Manhattan judge said the student could amend their request for a temporary restraining order and refile it if they address certain issues raised in court.
U.S. Rep. Tim Walberg, a Michigan Republican who chairs the House Education and Workforce Committee, called the decision a “victory for credible oversight." He said a court-ordered injunction would interfere with an ongoing congressional inquiry.
“The work to investigate antisemitism on our nation’s college campuses and develop legislative solutions will continue,” he said in a statement. "Our Committee will not sit by idly as a wave of antisemitic threats flood our colleges and universities and interfere with students’ education.”
Lawyers for Khalil and the other students said the decision means they can continue pursuing their legal fight against the congressional efforts.
“We now know that the government is testing the First Amendment’s limits, and the limits of what we as a society will allow,” the lawyers wrote in a statement. “We, as a collective, must stand together against these unlawful incursions into our protected speech.”
Khalil, a Columbia graduate student who is facing deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel, and other students had requested the order after filing a lawsuit seeking to block the House Committee on Education and the Workforce from obtaining disciplinary records for students involved in demonstrations.
The group had also asked the judge to stop the Trump administration from going through with threats to terminate Columbia’s federal funding and the school from complying with the government's demands for policy changes. But Subramanian said they needed to explain what standing they had to challenge these moves.
The judge noted that some student records had already been turned over, but that Columbia says the documents were scrubbed of all identifying information and that it doesn't intend to produce any more records at this time.
A spokesperson for Columbia didn't immediately comment.
